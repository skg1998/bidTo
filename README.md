# BidTo

> ## Online Bidding site

> Besides having a good amount of money users are still not 
able to buy new, unique, and ancestral products over the 
internet, or having a product, users are not getting a good 
amount for that product. By considering the gap between 
users (buyer/seller) we are proposing the solution of an 
online bidding system that limits the gap to buyer and seller 
with safe and secure transactions.

By using this application users: -
  1) Can initiate any bid whether public or private.
  Public bid: bid which will be shown for all the 
  registered users.
  Private bid: bid where the seller allows 
  participation for this bid.
  2) Can participate in any public bid.
  3) Join the bidding competitive live in real-time.
